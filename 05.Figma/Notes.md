    There are a few other ways to add a flow starting point to your prototype:
    With the starting frame selected, click in the Flow starting point section of the right sidebar.
    Right-click on the frame, then click Add starting point.

# **SITEMAP**

    NOTE: A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page's interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and
    priorization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors.

# **PROTOTYPING**

    NOTE: Allow you to create intereactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs.
    Prototypes are a fantastic way to : Preview **interactions** and user flows.

# **TYPOGRAPHY**

# **COLOR SCHEMES**

**Monochromatic**

This colors will share the tense hues and tones of one primary color.
In theory, it's the simplest of all color schemes.
NOTE: And these are mostly used in minimal designs because one hue generally results in a less distracting layout.

**Analogous**

This is based off of three colors located next to each other on the color wheel.

**Complimentary**

A complementary color scheme is composed by using two colors opposite each other on the color wheel.

**Split Complimentary**

A split complementary scheme involves the use of three colors. Start with one color, find its complement and then
use the two colors on either side of it. For Example, the complement of blue-green is red-orange and the split complement of blue-green would be red and orange.

**Triadic**

A triadic color scheme, a unique variant of the split complementary color scheme, with an equal distance between
all colors.

All three colors are distributed evenly around the color wheel, causing there to be no clear superiority of one color.
