# **DESIGN RULES**

- Connection between **color and shape**
- Clean, Powerful typograohy
- Spatial relationships and integration of shape, color and typography.
- Core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis.
- Form should be determined by **succes criteria** not by function or personal aesthetic preferences.

# **LESS IS MORE**

## **Hiding elements can be costly**

### **Icons without labels are worse than labels alone.**

- Designers believe that icons or pictures provide a greater degree of recognition while saving screen space.
- In fact, they often go unused - because they're vague.

# **FIVE RULES FOR EFFECTIVE UI DESIGN ON SMALL SCREENS**

## **1. FOCUS ON CONTEXT OF USE**

- When are people using the app/site?
- When they're stressed?
- When they're bored?
- When they're busy?
- When they're lost?

The available features and functions - and the way they work - should fit the situation.

## **2. Simplify**

- Each screen should contain **One primary action.**
- No more
- That means every screen should provide something useful, meaningful and valuable.
- This makes the product easier to learn, easier to use and easier for you to add to later.
- Abandon the idea that the numbers of screens (or steps) matters. It doesn't.

## **3. Design for thumbs**

- Can people use their **thumbs** to do the majority of the work?
- Steven Hoober's research on mobile device usage found that the vast majority of people use one or both thumbs to interact on their phones.
- Place main menu items, frequently-used controls and common actions within easy thumb reach.
