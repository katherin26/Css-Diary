# **DESIGN RULES**

- Connection between **color and shape**
- Clean, Powerful typograohy
- Spatial relationships and integration of shape, color and typography.
- Core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis.
- Form should be determined by **succes criteria** not by function or personal aesthetic preferences.

# **LESS IS MORE**

## **Hiding elements can be costly**

### **Icons without labels are worse than labels alone.**

- Designers believe that icons or pictures provide a greater degree of recognition while saving screen space.
- In fact, they often go unused - because they're vague.

# **FIVE RULES FOR EFFECTIVE UI DESIGN ON SMALL SCREENS**

## **1. FOCUS ON CONTEXT OF USE**

- When are people using the app/site?
- When they're stressed?
- When they're bored?
- When they're busy?
- When they're lost?

The available features and functions - and the way they work - should fit the situation.

## **2. Simplify**

- Each screen should contain **One primary action.**
- No more
- That means every screen should provide something useful, meaningful and valuable.
- This makes the product easier to learn, easier to use and easier for you to add to later.
- Abandon the idea that the numbers of screens (or steps) matters. It doesn't.

## **3. Design for thumbs**

- Can people use their **thumbs** to do the majority of the work?
- Steven Hoober's research on mobile device usage found that the vast majority of people use one or both thumbs to interact on their phones.
- Place main menu items, frequently-used controls and common actions within easy thumb reach.

## **4. Design for fat fingers**

- Controls and their associated tap targets should be a minumun of 9 mm (48px) in diameter.
- Anything smaller than that takes it hard to tap easily and accurately.
- **Provide ample space between targets** so user don't accidentally tap the wrong target.

## **5. Minimize the need to type.**

- Even in the best of circumstances, typing on a phone is a pain.
- It's a **slow** process, almost always filled with **errors** so the less it's needed, the better.
- Keep forms short and simple, be ruthless about removing unnecessary fields.
- Use auto-complete and personalized data where possible.
- Make the tech do more so the user can do less.

## **6. Balance**

- Balancing any layout means arranging positive elements and negative space so that no one area of the design overpowers the others (unless it's supposed to).
- Everything works and fits together.
- When a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole.
- They call too much attention to themselves; focus is on the trees instead of the forest.

## **6.1 Improving balance**

- In a content-heavy layout, balancing negative and positive space is mission - critical.
- This allows the user to quickly scan, identify and group related visual elements.

## **7. Rhythm**

- Rhythm occurs when the intervals between elements are predictable - and similiar in size, shape and length.
- When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythm speeds identification and the user's ability to quickly:

1. Infer what the elements are.
2. Understand what they do.

## **8. More constrast = more dominance**

- More negative space = more dominance.

## **9. Color Matters**

- Color gets attention.
- Color stirs emotional response and suggest associated meaning.
- To prevent confusion in meaning, color has to be used consistenly.
- To get the desired emotional response, color has to be used **appropriately.**
- The right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen.
- Color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue.
- Color delivers symbolic meanings that support and enhance the visual experience of a design.
- Color pleases the eye and sustains visual interest.

## **10. How colors Influences Interaction**

- Interaction CUE (same color)
- State change (is in different color because is another interaction.)
- Color should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI.
- It should highlight and guide.
- For extended screen use situations, use light, muted background colors.
- Bright, saturated colors should only be used as visual accents.

## **11. Color theory is useful**

- But it's also a real **Pain in the ass**.
- You're never going to have the time you need to fully understand color theory, much less apply it during a project.

## **How to Choose the Right colors for your UI**

- Common Associations.
- Emotional Impact.
- From the world around you.

## **12. Look at the world around you**

Everything you see contains the four color variations required for good UI design.

- Shadows.
- Midtones.
- Highlights.
- Accents.

## ** Using contrast to Improve Readability, Attention and Focus.**

- Text is easily readable when stark, complementary colors are used.
- A design where text is the brightest element can reduce eye strain by focusing attention.
- Lack of contrast between text and background strains the eyes because they don't know which color to focus on.
- The fact that colors are complementary doesn't mean constrast is appropiate. If both colors are too bright, eye
  strain is again the result.

## ** Constrast Directs Focus**

- Design with contrast **purposefully** keeps the user's focus where it needs to be.
- The **core content or action** should have the most contrast.
- Secondary content and actions (and everything else) should have **lower constrast**, by degrees.

1. Contrast draws the user's attention to the essential components of the interface.
2. Contrast helps the user understand relationships between onscreen elements.
3. Contrast communicates hierarchy and signifies importance within and across multiple sets of visual information.

## ** Typography serves functional purpose**

Appropriate typography choises create :

- Readability.
- Accessubility.
- Usability.
- Visual balance.

All of which work together to form effective, understandable visual **communication**.

## **Use Style to visually differentiate content.**

- When choosing a typeface, you want one that has at least 3 styles: **regular,italic + bold**.
- Use those styles in your design to differentiate between types of content.
- Sometimes this removes the need for more than one font entirely - every level of information can be signified with styling.

## **There are four core types of icons**

- Similar : Icons are useful for simple, easily understood actions and concepts.
- Symbolic : Icons represent an action, object, or concept at high abstraction.
- Example : Use images of things that exemplify or are commonly associated with an action, object, or concept.
- Arbitrary : Icons bear no resemblance to the represented concept, their meaning is learned through repeated exposure.
