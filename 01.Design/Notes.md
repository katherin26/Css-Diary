# **DESIGN RULES**

- Connection between **color and shape**
- Clean, Powerful typograohy
- Spatial relationships and integration of shape, color and typography.
- Core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis.
- Form should be determined by **succes criteria** not by function or personal aesthetic preferences.

# **LESS IS MORE**

## **Hiding elements can be costly**

### **Icons without labels are worse than labels alone.**

- Designers believe that icons or pictures provide a greater degree of recognition while saving screen space.
- In fact, they often go unused - because they're vague.

# **FIVE RULES FOR EFFECTIVE UI DESIGN ON SMALL SCREENS**

## **1. FOCUS ON CONTEXT OF USE**

- When are people using the app/site?
- When they're stressed?
- When they're bored?
- When they're busy?
- When they're lost?

The available features and functions - and the way they work - should fit the situation.

## **2. Simplify**

- Each screen should contain **One primary action.**
- No more
- That means every screen should provide something useful, meaningful and valuable.
- This makes the product easier to learn, easier to use and easier for you to add to later.
- Abandon the idea that the numbers of screens (or steps) matters. It doesn't.

## **3. Design for thumbs**

- Can people use their **thumbs** to do the majority of the work?
- Steven Hoober's research on mobile device usage found that the vast majority of people use one or both thumbs to interact on their phones.
- Place main menu items, frequently-used controls and common actions within easy thumb reach.

## **4. Design for fat fingers**

- Controls and their associated tap targets should be a minumun of 9 mm (48px) in diameter.
- Anything smaller than that takes it hard to tap easily and accurately.
- **Provide ample space between targets** so user don't accidentally tap the wrong target.

## **5. Minimize the need to type.**

- Even in the best of circumstances, typing on a phone is a pain.
- It's a **slow** process, almost always filled with **errors** so the less it's needed, the better.
- Keep forms short and simple, be ruthless about removing unnecessary fields.
- Use auto-complete and personalized data where possible.
- Make the tech do more so the user can do less.

## **6. Balance**

- Balancing any layout means arranging positive elements and negative space so that no one area of the design overpowers the others (unless it's supposed to).
- Everything works and fits together.
- When a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole.
- They call too much attention to themselves; focus is on the trees instead of the forest.

## **6.1 Improving balance**

- In a content-heavy layout, balancing negative and positive space is mission - critical.
- This allows the user to quickly scan, identify and group related visual elements.

## **7. Rhythm**

- Rhythm occurs when the intervals between elements are predictable - and similiar in size, shape and length.
- When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythm speeds identification and the user's ability to quickly:

1. Infer what the elements are.
2. Understand what they do.

## **8. More constrast = more dominance**

- More negative space = more dominance.

## **9. Color Matters**

- Color gets attention.
- Color stirs emotional response and suggest associated meaning.
- To prevent confusion in meaning, color has to be used consistenly.
- To get the desired emotional response, color has to be used **appropriately.**
- The right colors draw the eye to the most important areas on the screen.
- Color can maximize readability and minimize optical fatigue.
- Color delivers symbolic meanings that support and enhance the visual experience of a design.
- Color pleases the eye and sustains visual interest.

## **10. How colors Influences Interaction**

- Interaction CUE (same color)
- State change (is in different color because is another interaction.)
- Color should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI.
- It should highlight and guide.
- For extended screen use situations, use light, muted background colors.
- Bright, saturated colors should only be used as visual accents.
