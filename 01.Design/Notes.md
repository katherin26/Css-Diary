- Clean, Powerful typograohy
- Spatial relationships and integration of shape, color and typography.
- Core principles of visual design such as harmony, balance, rhythm, proportion, symmetry and synthesis.
- Form should be determined by **succes criteria** not by function or personal aesthetic preferences.

# **LESS IS MORE**

## **Hiding elements can be costly**

### **Icons without labels are worse than labels alone.**

- Designers believe that icons or pictures provide a greater degree of recognition while saving screen space.
- In fact, they often go unused - because they're vague.
